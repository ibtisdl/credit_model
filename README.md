# Credit Model

## Overview

This project involves the development of a credit scoring model using machine learning techniques. The goal of the model is to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan based on various features.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to identify patterns and correlations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model performance.
- **Model Selection**: Comparing different machine learning algorithms to select the best-performing model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
